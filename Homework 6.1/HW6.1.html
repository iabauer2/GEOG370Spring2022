    <h2>Nebraskan Counties</h2>
    <h3>This map shows the number of people in each Nebraskan county who are uninsured as of 2018. The individuals range from ages 18 to 64, although this is not represented in the map. The resulting map shows that Douglas, Sarpy, and Lancaster counties are the most uninsured. These counties are also some of the largest by population size, so the rate of insurance coverage may be misrepresented in this map. Additionally, the map is displayed in EPSG 32614, which it UTM zone 14N. </h3>
